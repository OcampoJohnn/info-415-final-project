The Department of Homeland Security as well as the Department of Justice along with some security tech companies like Norton report that scam call centers are present in some central American countries like Costa Rica and Venezuela, but the fact remains that over seventy percent of scam call centers are located in India simply because there is a large segment of the population that already speaks English and is therefore conveniently situated to target consumers of English speaking nations. Moreover, the fact that India already has a large manufacturing sector in the country, works to its advantage because multiple investigations from India’s own justice department have revealed that scam call centers regularly take or occupy manufacturing or business districts that were already set in place. In other words, scam call centers in India can easily blend with the rest of the legitimate businesses that surround them in the area. Police forces in Mumbai, for example, have routinely reported that scam call centers are difficult to uncover because they choose to be located next to legitimate businesses with frequent clients. In fact, providing working or initial capital to fund new scam call centers in India is actually not that uncommon as many directors will often boast about the returns on investment citing profit numbers from previous call centers.
